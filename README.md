# Low Level Design (LLD) Practice Repository

This repository is a personal learning space where I **proactively practice Low Level Design (LLD) concepts** by **designing systems and implementing them in code**.

The goal is to bridge the gap between **theoretical design principles** and **practical, executable implementations**, similar to what is expected in real-world engineering and interviews.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of **object-oriented design principles**
- Practice **thinking in terms of classes, responsibilities, and interactions**
- Convert **LLD diagrams and ideas into clean, maintainable code**
- Build intuition for **scalability, extensibility, and code readability**
- Prepare for **LLD / Machine Coding / Design interviews**

---

## 🧩 What This Repository Contains

- Real-world **LLD problems** (e.g. systems, services, utilities)
- Step-by-step **design thought process**
- Well-structured **code implementations**
- Usage of:
  - SOLID principles
  - Design patterns (where applicable)
  - Interfaces & abstractions
  - Clean class responsibilities

Each problem focuses on **design clarity first**, followed by correct and clean implementation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: **Python**
- Emphasis on:
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Design patterns
  - Clean architecture

_(Language choice is secondary; design quality is the primary focus.)_
